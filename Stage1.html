        Major Peices Of Web

      <article class="theory-content">
        <p>The major peices of web are <b><em>"You"</em></b> <b><em> ,"Your Browser",</em></b>
          <b><em> "The internet"</em></b> and <b><em> "The Servers"</em></b>.<br>
          when we have to search a file, it send the request from internet to servers via HTTP. The internet uses HTTP to comunicate with you,
          your browser and server.

      </header>
      <article class="theory-content">
        <p>Hypertext Markup Language(HTML) is what keeps everything together, all the Text,Images, Videos and etc. HTML contains Text contents is "What we see" and Markup whoch describes "HOw it looks".
          All the pages are interconnected because of hyperlinks. Hyperlinks are the special links which connects other oages.This <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-4185478836/m-48724340">video</a> gives a good explaination.

      HTML Markup

    <article class="theory-content">
      <p>HTML markup is made of html tags. With help of "Tags" we tell the browser the type of element. HTML document is made of HTML element. For better overview check this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-4185478836/m-48723444">video</a>.

      Inline vs Block element
    </header>
    <article class="theory-content">
      <p>Inline element just break the text and start the new text, "BR" tag is one of the example of inline element. <br>Block element breaks the text and make an invisible block. The invisible block has width.

      computers are stupid
    </header>
    <article class="theory-content">
      <p>Programmers need to write exactly the way a <em>computer 
        understands</em> (also known as writing with correct "syntax").<br>For example, if you forget to close a "em" tag, the computer won't 
        be able to understand what you wanted to emphasize and make itallics. <br>This 
        "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers
        incredible power.<br>Once you learn perfectly to cammond to a computer than you
        can tell it to do anything you want.<br>
        <b>The computer follow the instruction literally. Thus they are refered as stupid.</b>

    Tree-Like Structure.
  </header>
  <article class="theory-content" style="display: flex;">
    <p>Tree-Like Structure is very interesting topic, and it helps to make our coding
      very systematic. It is also known as <span class="italic">Branching</span>.
      <br>The name itself gives a breef idea that the html coding have elements inside other elements. The best was to put in simple words is, On top are our "<span class="italic">Grand Parents</span>"...below our grand parents are our "<span class="italic">Parents</span>"...and below parents are "<span class="italic">Children</span>"...and below children will b their children and so on.
      Thus this nesting and putting child element in parent element makes our coding more systematic and clean. Specialy very helpful in complex coding.

   <article class="theory-content">
    <p>Its funny but the fact is everything are boxes on web-page. Imagine a world where only thing which exist is the box. Its very difficult to imagine but thats what make things simpler in <span class="italic">Web-Designing</span><br>
      Following link will give better explaination of this concept and its very interesting too.

    <article class="theory-content">
      <p><u>HTML:</u> <span class="italic"><u>HyperText Markup Language</u></span><br> The standard markup language used to creat web page.
        <br><u>CSS:</u> <span class="italic"><u>Cascading Style Sheets.</u></span><br>
        Style sheet language used for designing the look and formation of a document written in a markup language.<br>
        <u>DOM:</u> <span class="italic"><u>Document Object Model</u></span><br> A cross platform and language independent conversation for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup language). The nodes of every DOC are organised in a tree srtucture called DOM tree.<br>
        The browser turns the tag into elements that forms tree. the browser is able to make a tree is beacause of "DOM".

    <header class="sub-title">Avoiding Repetition
    </header>
    <article class="theory-content">
      <p>Avoiding repetition in our coding has lots and lots of benefits. As we'll learn ahead our coding will get more complex and bigger. Thus writing a structured code and avoiding repetition of same code will help us in:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>Making less mistakes</li>
        <li>Spotting the errors will be easy</li>
        <li>Saves lots of time</li>

    <header class="sub-title">Power Of CSS.
    </header>
    <article class="theory-content">
      <p>As we have learned above that CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) are used to decorate and make our web page look nice and beautiful and colorful. With html we write the code and with css we add style.
        css has lots of power, the best part of adding css is that we'll not have to repeat all the codes.
        For example if i want my all the headings to be "Red" and "italic" and "underlined", then simply I'll use CSS for it and thus I'll not have to repeat the coding for all of my headings and instead type it once and then I'll connect my CSS with my HTML.
        This will save lots of time and will maintain the consistancy of my work and will help me avoiding mistakes.
